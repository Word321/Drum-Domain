		<h1>Welcome to the Drum Domain!</h1>
		<p>
			This website was created in 2019 for a college class project. The webpage is still currently a work in progress and I will be using my knowledge from class to update it.<br><br>
			Welcome to the Drum Domain.<br /><br />
			A website with the purpose of serving information for those who would like to learn about the history of the modern day drumkit, or how to hit skins and be decent at it. As this website progresses, new and exciting page will be opening up. I would like to teach as many people about this wonderful and amazing hobby of mine.

		<h1>History Lesson!</h1>
		<p style="line-height:200%;">
			The drum is a musical instrument that has been around for thousands of years. It is still one of the most popular parts of music today. Drums are also known as membranphones and are speculated as the oldest known instrument that the human race learned to use. Drums are made up of a membrane which is stretched over a open cylinder, which when struck vibrate the air waves inside the shell. Below is a timeline depicting the history of the drum.<br /><br /><br />

			<br /><b>1200 A.D.</b><br />
			During the Crusades, the Mediterranean opened new trade routes, bringing new influnence from the Middle East and Asia to Genoa and Venice, Italy. Drums were among the commodities brought over.
			<br /><b>1450-1600 A.D.</b><br />	
			Drums begin to be used in war time. Large expansions of these percussion instruments are used to signal attacks or to strike intimidation into enemy forces. African drums are brought over to the Americas by the slave trade. Percussion instruments such as long drums, snares, jingle bells, and tambourines begin to be used in Renaissance festivals.
			<br /><b>1820 A.D. - Modern Day</b><br />
			Invention of the gong, vibraphone, small snare, and kettle drum. These instruments become popular with professional musicians and composers, which brings the percussion instuments into popular and complicated orchestra pieces. In 1909 the first Patent for the foot pedal and professional drum kit comes to light. Throughout the 1900's, cymbals, larger kits, and even the double bass pedal appear with modern day professional kits. It wasn't until technology grew, that in 1973, Karl Bartos invented the electric drum set which allowed digital recordings of drum rhythm's to be used with computer systems.
